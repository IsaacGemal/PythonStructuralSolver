# Baisc Structural Analysis in Python

This Python script performs simple structural analysis, calculating displacements and reactions in a predefined structural system.

It's adapted from a college MATLAB assignment I did a few years back (though quite frankly I have no idea how it works now).

Translated from Matlab to Python with tremendous help from GPT-4 because matlab code is just not fun or easy to work with.
